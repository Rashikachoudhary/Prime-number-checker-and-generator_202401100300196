# Prime-number-checker-and-generator_202401100300196

This Python program is designed to efficiently check whether a given number is prime and generate a list of prime numbers within a specified range. It uses the trial division method, where divisibility is tested only up to the square root of the number, improving performance. If a divisor is found, the program exits early to save computation time. The program also allows user input for both prime checking and prime generation, providing clear and readable output.
For prime checking, the output states whether the number is prime or not.
For prime generation, the output shows the list of prime numbers within the specified range.
This approach ensures that the program is both efficient and easy to use while handling a wide range of input sizes.
